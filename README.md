This repo contains code to fine tune a Llama2-7b-chat model through a predefined pipeline. Azure chatgpt 4o was used to create the datasets based on the use case of the fine tuning.

Replace the keys with the relevant keys, which will successfully run the end to end pipeline to create the dataset, train the model, fine tune and to prompt it on the fine tuned data.
